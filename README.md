## EBRAINS Metadata Wizard

The EBRAINS Metadata Wizard is a web form that helps you describe key aspects of your research data so that other researchers will be able to find, reuse and cite your work once you share it on [EBRAINS](ebrains.eu). 

Metadata are collected according to the EBRAINS Common Curation Track, and organized in line with the openMINDS standard ([open Metadata Initiative for Neuroscience Data Structures](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS)):

- Data owner and contributors
- Experimental methods and subjects
- Licensing, embargo and funding
- Related publications

### Credits

The form is developed by the EBRAINS Data Curation Team based on the [openMINDS wizard](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openminds-wizard).
